# golang_snacks

golang_snacks is a collection of libraries to extend the standard library with an emphasis on robust
testing methodologies. Most importantly, it features a deterministic simulation testing framework.
These libraries natively integrate with the testing framework ensuring a robust third-party
dependency. The project combines zlib, BSD, and MIT licenses and guarantees it will never include
copyleft code.

> [!WARNING]
> These libraries are designed to be vendored and adapted to your needs. Breaking changes are
> force-pushed to main until morale improves.

## Licensing

Original libraries are released under the zlib license. Packages that replace standard library
equivalents use Google’s BSD-3 license. Popular third-party Go packages may be absorbed if widely
adopted by the community.
